# Create your tests here.

"""
Did not have time to write proper tests however, some tests that I think would be useful:
1. Make sure user cannot be created with same email address
2. Make sure that user cannot add address with same address_line_1 (additional test would be to check that 
   this is case insensitive)
3. Make sure that only authorised users can view the data
4. Check that users can only view their OWN set of addresses
